# Release Notes

## Release 3.0.17 - 16th Dec 2024

We are super excited to announce our first 3.0.17 release of Connectifi Platform! This is our first general audience release, bringing together all of the interoperability features of Connectifi and making them available with zero friction from installs, proprietary tech, or start up costs!  

You can read all about the platform release [here](https://connectifi.co/post/announcing-connectifi-platform).  And if you are new to the platform, you can read all about Connectifi and how to get started on our [docs site](https://docs.connectifi.co).   

Here is a quick tour of specific improvements in 3.0.17 over the previous (Beta) version:

### Directory creation and updating Steps

Weâ€™ve done some redesigning of the UX for managing [Directories](https://docs.connectifi.co/Directories).  To make the experience more manageable, we broke directory creation and updating into a stepped process and moved Delivery Hook management into a separate step.  

### Management features for Actions and Delivery Hooks

We made multiple improvements to the management of Delivery Hooks for Directories and [Actions](https://docs.connectifi.co/Actions/Actions) for Apps.   Two major changes are:

- Support for configuring headers on REST calls.
- Separating testing and property editing into different modals and tabs

### Additional Fixes and Improvements

We made many minor fixes and improvements based on your feedback and our own testing.  Some highlights are:

- Fixed a bug where application icons were not getting saved
- Fixed a bug where update changes were not immediately viewable after saving
- A number of fixes were made for managing of Contexts related to Intents
- Cleanup of the bread crumb navigation
- Fixes for style inconsistencies across buttons and forms
