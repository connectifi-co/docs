# Getting Started with Connectifi

[Connectifi](https://connectifi.co) is a cloud service that securely connects applications for interoperability across different technologies and devices. Applications connect into directories that use metadata to enable discoverability and sharing of data and functions across applications.  For example, an end user can dynamically discover what operations are available to them for a contact record in a CRM, such as opening related information in a different application, sharing the contact with a colleague, or exporting to another CRM.  To support this interoperability, Connectifi provides full stack integration including no-code administration of behavior and metadata, client SDKs for creating embedded experiences, REST API connectors, and Web hook trigger support.

Connectifi supports the FDC3 protocol and is the easiest way to use the FDC3 standard.   It works without installs, can be used directly in a browser, bridge across desktop containers, and even in mobile and across devices and VMs.

## Components
Connectifi integrations have these components:
* A Directory, that defines the application metadata and behavior for the specific integration.  Directories allow the administrator to set what applications can participate in the integration, what functions are supported, and behaviors around data and security.
* Application definitions that describe how an application can be discovered and called and what functions it supports.  Applications can have:
    * Agent SDKs for integrating the Connectifi service directly into an application client
    * Actions that expose rest APIs for the application
    * Receptors that create web hook triggers
* Metadata that creates a reusable grammar for dynamic interoperability.  Metadata in Connectifi leverages the FDC3 standard, but also supports extensions by organizations.  Metadata can be thought of as nouns and verbs and consists of:
    * Context, metadata that define the data that is exchanged between applications.
    * Intents, metadata that define the actions that applications can support.

## Next Steps

Getting started with Connectifi is easy!  Here are the next steps:

* If you don’t have an existing account, create one at https://platform.connectifi.app
* On [platform.connectifi.app](http://platform.connectifi.app) (or your own instance if you are an enterprise user), start by creating a Directory
* Add applications to your Directory, for applications you develop, add the Agent SDK to your application front end.  For other applications you can use Actions and Receptors to integrate with the application using deep link and REST APIs.
* Decide what Intents and Contexts your applications will support.  If you don’t see what you need in the default library, then feel free to create your own.
* Use the Client SDK to create triggers from your application UI.  If an application already uses FDC3, you can connect the Agent SDK directly with these APIs.  The Connectifi Agent SDK will also integrate and bridge with local FDC3 integrations if desired.
* If an application requires REST integration, use an existing connector or create your own with our Connector SDK and at it as an Action or Receptor for the application.
* Keep it simple and iterate.  Connectifi makes it easy to start with very simple integrations and then incrementally improve and expand over time.
