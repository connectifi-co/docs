# Components
* A Directory, that defines the application metadata and behavior for the specific integration.  Directories allow the administrator to set what applications can participate in the integration, what functions are supported, and behaviors around data and security.
* Application definitions, that describe how an application can be discovered and called and what functions it supports.  Applications can have:
    * Agent SDKs for integrating the Connectifi service directly into an application client
    * Actions that expose rest APIs for the application
    * Receptors that create web hook triggers
* Metadata that creates a reusable grammar for dynamic interoperability.  Metadata in Connectifi leverages the FDC3 standard, but also supports extensions by organizations.  Metadata can be thought of as nouns and verbs and consists of:
    * Context, metadata that define the data that is exchanged between applications.
    * Intents, metadata that define the actions that applications can support.
