# Using the Connectifi Demo Resources

Connectifi hosts a sandbox environment with dev tools and a number of demo applications that can be used for development, testing, and prototyping.

## Sandbox

The Connectifi Sandbox offers a range of tools for testing the Web Agent SDK using FDC3 APIs including broadcast, channels, and intents.

## Connecting to the Sandbox and Demos Directory
The sandbox directory is `Open`, so you can connect any app you want to and integrate with the Sandbox tool or interoperate with any of the Apps and Services in the directory.  

To connect your app, just add the Agent SDK to your web app and run the following connection code:

Using the CDN:

```js
      <script type="module">

      import { createAgent } from 'https://platform.connectifi.app/agent/main.bundle.js';
        const fdc3 = await createAgent(
              `https://platform.connectifi.app`,
              `*@sandbox`,
            );
      </script>
```

Using NPM:

```js
      import { createAgent } from '@connectifi/agent-web';
      const fdc3 = await createAgent(
              `https://platform.connectifi.app`,
              `*@sandbox`,
            );
```

**Note:** As with all Open directories, if your App is publishing sensitive data, we recommend you don't connect it.
