# Receptors

Receptors define incoming data endpoints allowing external services to push context data to end-users, raise intents, or call other APIs. Receptor hooks can be used for a wide range of use cases such as:

* Push in-app alerts to users from backend services
* Integrations between FDC3 applications and back-end services and non-FDC3 applications such as SaaS applications, CLIs, and macros
* Sharing context objects between users.

Receptors equip your applications to:

1. **Broadcast:** Broadcast context to a channel on behalf of a user.
2. **Multi Broadcast:**  Broadcast context to a channel for multiple users.
3. **Raise Intent:** Raise an intent on behalf of a user. 
4. **Find Intent:**  Call the findIntent API on behalf of a user.

## Creating a Receptor

When creating an application, you can add Receptors. Click on the top-right of the screen to 'Add Receptor'. The receptor will generate a unique API Key to be used in the request.  As will all keys, keep this secret and rotate frequently.

## User identity

All Receptors connect into specific user sessions.  Users are identified by email, so directories using Receptors must be of types `Open & Auth` or `Strict` (i.e. require user login) for the Receptor to b functional.
