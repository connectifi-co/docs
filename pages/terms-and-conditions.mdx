14. **Dispute Resolution**

    1. ***Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes.*** We each agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Service (collectively, “**Disputes**”) will be resolved solely by binding, individual arbitration and not in a class, representative or consolidated action or proceeding. You and Connectifi agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these Terms, and the laws of the state of New York shall apply to the resolution of all Disputes, irrespective of any choice of law principles. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND CONNECTIFI ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.

    2. ***Exceptions.*** As limited exceptions to section 14.1. above: (i) we both may seek to resolve a Dispute in small claims court where you live or where Connectifi is located (if it qualifies); and (ii) we each retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief from a court to prevent (or enjoin) the infringement or misappropriation of our respective intellectual property rights.

    3. ***Conducting Arbitration and Arbitration Rules.*** The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“**AAA**”) in accordance with the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “**AAA Rules**”) then in effect. The AAA Rules are available at [https://www.adr.org/Rules](https://www.adr.org/Rules) and general information on the AAA process is found at www.adr.org. Information on how to initiate the arbitration is found at that website. The arbitration shall be, if possible, conducted either on the basis of documents or remotely. If an in-person hearing is necessary, the location of the arbitration will be in the borough of Manhattan, New York. The language to be used in the arbitration will be English. In all Disputes there shall be one (1) arbitrator. The arbitrator shall be appointed pursuant to the provisions for appointing an arbitrator in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator shall issue a decision in writing, briefly explaining the reasons therefor, and may award remedies that are available at law or in equity (so long as consistent with all of these Terms. Please be advised that these Terms contains certain limitations on the type and amount of damages that may be awarded). The arbitrator shall have no power to amend or supplement these Terms to award damages other than as permitted herein, or to fail to follow applicable laws and regulations. Any award rendered by the arbitrator shall be final and binding on the parties, and may be confirmed by the judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms / Privacy Policy.

    4. ***Arbitration Costs.*** Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules, and each party shall bear its own costs and expenses of arbitration, including legal fees.

    5. ***Injunctive and Declaratory Relief.*** Except as provided in section 14.2. above, the arbitrator shall determine all issues of liability on the merits of any claim asserted by either party and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. To the extent that you or we prevail on a claim and seek public injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the public), the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. The parties agree that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual claims in arbitration.

    6. ***Class Action Waiver.*** YOU AND CONNECTIFI AGREE THAT EACH PARTY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, if the parties’ Dispute is resolved through arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate another person’s claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution section shall be null and void.
