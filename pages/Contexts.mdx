# Contexts

Contexts are the pieces of data/content that can be used by intents and applications. Contexts define types of data to be transferred between applications. Contexts can be shared directly by broadcast or paired with Intents to perform a specific action such as launching or triggering a specific function of an application or retrieving data from a remote service. Contexts can be viewed as having two types:

- Output contexts control active contexts. When an intent is matched, any configured output contexts for that intent become active.
- Input contexts control intent matching.
