# Release Notes

## Release 3.0.32 - 8th Jan 2025

We are thrilled to announce the 3.0.32 release of Connectifi Platform, 
which includes a Templates feature to accelerate the development of use cases as well as multiple general updates.


### Introducing Connectifi Templates
Understanding and implementing the FDC3 standard can be complex, particularly for developers who are new to the financial services industry. 
The need to grasp concepts like context, intents, and app directories can pose a steep learning curve and developers must consider a broad range of use cases and how to fit interoperability to specific workflows.  
Connectifi Templates accelerates this process with single-click set up of interoperability use cases that can then be customized and expanded on.

Our first templates cover the following use cases:

- **Contact Management** Managing a list of contacts and integrating fdc3.contact context data with any number of receiving applications.
- **Cross Device** Extending interoperability workflows across devices via broadcast and intents.
- **Financial Management** Creating a ticker watchlist and connecting to common financial applications such as news feeds and charts.
- **Sharing** Adding a share button to your content to automatically connect it to collaboration and social applications.
