# Release Notes

## Release 3.0.47 - 15th Jan 2025

We are thrilled to announce our 3.0.47 release of Connectifi Platform, 
which features the addition of federation with Google along with multiple general updates.


### Google Federation
Users can now create accounts and sign in using their existing Google identities.  
This applies to both the admin panel as well as authentication for apps requiring sign-in to Connectifi.  
Have additional IDP's you would like to see Connectifi Federate with?  Let us know on [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1296580749130203208/1296580749599969362) or at support@connectifi.co.

- Global Context and Intents definitions will now display on the top level [Contexts](https://platform.connectifi.app/contexts) and [Intents](https://platform.connectifi.app/intents) pages by default. 
- Context and Intent creation CTA is now dismissible on the top level Context and Intent pages.
- A bug in windows causing extra scroll bars has been fixed
- UI bugs related to applying Contexts to an Application's Intents have been fixed
- A number of improvements to layout and response and themes support have been made
