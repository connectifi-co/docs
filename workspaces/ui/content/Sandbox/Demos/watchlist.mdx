# Watchlist
An interactive watchlist grid built on data from [Polygon.io](https://polygon.io).  Whether you're building a trading app, a robo-advisor, or anything in between, Polygon.io's institutional-level data access can help you make better decisions and deliver better results.

## Application Name
In the **Application Info** step, set *Application Name* as `watchlist`.

## Start URL & Intents

In the **Agent SDK** step, select SDK Type of *Web App*.

Set *Start URL* as (substituting the code for your directory as described [earlier](/Sandbox/Imports)): `https://demos.connectifi.app/platform/{YOUR_DIRECTORY_CODE}/watchlist`

### Configure Supported Intents
This registers the intents the app supports with the directory, so that the app is fully discoverable and can be launched using the *start url* provided.

Select the Intent: `SendToWatchlist`

Select the following supported Contexts: 
- `fdc3.instrument`
- `fdc3.instrumentList` 
- `fdc3.portfolio`

**Note:** once youâ€™ve added an intent, click on the chip for the intent to get the picker list for contexts.

Test the app using its Start URL, it should load and connect to the directory. If it has registered intents, it will now be discoverable.
